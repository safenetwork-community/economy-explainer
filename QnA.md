Q  What is the difference between Farming and DBCs?
A DBC is the token mechanism, how to transfer tokens between entities.

Farming or earning etc. is the service that users pay for with tokens. The mechanism from user paying to resource providers getting paid uses DBCs to make payments and the network identifying who to be paid for what work.

Q What is this SAFE Network all about?
A At the core it’s ‘just a chat system for machines’. They tell each other what to do and if they don’t do it they tell each other about that. Sometimes people chat too (uploads / downloads) but right at the root of it is machines saying ‘do we agree about stuff’.
If someone starts talking trash, the machines can cope.
If lots of trash comes all of a sudden the machines can probably still cope.
